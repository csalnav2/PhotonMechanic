LLM Computational Graph Profiler & Memory Analyzer
Author: [Your Name or GitHub Username]
License: Apache 2.0

üîç Overview
This application provides a comprehensive profiling tool for large language models (LLMs) by analyzing computational graphs, memory efficiency, FLOPs, and time complexity. Users can dynamically explore various sequence lengths, quantization methods, reinforcement learning techniques, and graph structures, generating real-time 3D visualizations and extracting key model performance insights.

‚ö° Features
‚úÖ Model Selection: Supports Hugging Face models like GPT-2, DistilBERT, and BERT-BASE.
‚úÖ Quantization Options: Choose between FP32, FP16, and INT8 for model execution.
‚úÖ Custom Time Complexity Trends: Supports logarithmic, linear, parabolic (O(n¬≤)), etc.
‚úÖ Reinforcement Learning Support: Includes Meta, Chain-of-Thought, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and DQN.
‚úÖ GPU Selection: Compare performance across T4, A100, B100, and other GPUs.
‚úÖ Graph-Based Analysis:

Hypergraph Generation: Template-level model execution flow.
Computational Graph: Detailed execution trace for individual operations.
‚úÖ 3D & 2D Visualizations:
Queue Space State-Action 3D Surface
3D Scatterplots of Memory, Time, and FLOPs.
‚úÖ Speech-to-Text Integration (Upcoming Feature! üöÄ):
Planned support for Whisper to analyze the impact of speech-transcribed text on model performance.
‚úÖ Computation Graph Glossary: Defines each node operation, execution order, and efficiency metrics.
